# Project Future Scope

Currently, the **Project Performance Analysis System** uses static datasets to demonstrate core analytical and visualization capabilities.

## The "Big Task" (Phase 2)

Upon approval of the current prototype, the system will be upgraded to include:

1.  **Live GitHub API Integration**: 
    - Replacing static CSV loading with real-time data fetching.
    - Connecting to live repositories to track Commits, PRs, and Issues.

2.  **Dynamic Metrics**:
    - Analyzing real-time software engineering metrics (e.g., Code Frequency, Bug Fix Rate).
